# Schema and non-destructive migration

The schema is defined in `apps-script/Store.gs`, not spreadsheet row numbers. `Schema.gs` plans and creates only missing tabs in a separately configured development spreadsheet. Existing named tabs with different headers cause a clear error; no automatic overwrite/delete occurs. The existing production spreadsheet ID is explicitly refused when MEALS_ENV is development.

| Tab         | Durable identifier | Purpose                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EVENTS      | EventID            | Status, capacity, delivery date, pickup address, archive/version/route metadata                                        |
| REFERRALS   | ReferralID         | Organization, status, immutable original submission totals, optimistic version                                         |
| RECIPIENTS  | RecipientID        | Referral/Event relationships, meal count, independent delivery/dietary/internal fields, address review, route position |
| AUDITLOG    | AuditID            | Administrative actions with protected old/new values                                                                   |
| ADMINUSERS  | Email              | Private active administrator allowlist                                                                                 |
| SUBMISSIONS | SubmissionID       | Payload fingerprint and original successful minimal receipt                                                            |

The writer generates append/update cells in one Sheets API batch and writes literal typed strings, numbers and booleans. It rejects removed existing records. Existing row positions are found by IDs each time; sorting rows does not break relationships. Any service exception yields a generic safe error. The script lock spans current-state reads, capacity/version checks and the one final write; no external Maps call is made inside that transaction.

Pending and Approved referrals reserve current MealCount. Rejected referrals release reservations. OriginalRequestedMeals remains immutable on edits. Reports use current statuses/quantities for current reserved/approved/rejected values and the original snapshot for originally requested meals; those are different measures and need not sum after edits.

Legacy Requests/Settings are preserved. The original headers have no permanent IDs, EventID, organization contacts or MealCount. Legacy Comments may mean delivery instructions, internal notes, or something else. `legacyMigrationPlan_` reports a dry-run summary on test legacy rows without outputting their personal contents or changing their data. No actual legacy import is implemented/applied because the missing assignments and comment meaning require source inspection and explicit mapping approval. This is an intentional external dependency, not silent migration.

Before a future approved import:

1. Back up the original workbook privately; do not export personal records into the public Git repository.
2. Inspect record counts and missing fields privately.
3. Approve target event, organization assignment, meal-quantity interpretation and Comments mapping.
4. Preserve original Comments and all legacy fields in a private immutable source snapshot.
5. Design/import with durable source keys and a migration ledger so rerunning cannot duplicate imported records.
6. Dry-run and test rollback/atomicity on synthetic matching data before any real import.
7. Apply only after separate mapping and release approval.

Normal event reopening/unarchiving requires an explicit confirmation and protected audit entry. Completed events reopen to Closed. Public visibility depends on Open + not archived, not on an independent remaining counter.
